# Pearson Regression Coefficient calculation

This is implementation to count Pearson Regression Coefficient, based on 2 data sets.
The system does not allow anything that is not a number, floats are ok. 
Calculations are all handwritten.
The system displays all data being calculated, upon pressing "Calculate" including means etc.
It then shows coefficient in number and whether it has a No Correlation/Low/Strong

Used temp values for validating, to make sure no error is found, and only upon pressing "Add" are they added to the dataset.
